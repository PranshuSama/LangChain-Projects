# 🚀 LangChain Projects Collection

This repository contains my hands-on exploration and implementation of \*\*LangChain\*\*, focusing on building intelligent AI applications using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 📌 About LangChain

LangChain is a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by Large Language Models. It provides tools to integrate LLMs with external data sources, APIs, memory, and workflows, enabling the creation of intelligent, context-aware systems.

Instead of using LLMs only for text generation, LangChain allows developers to build complete pipelines where models can:

- Retrieve and process external data

- Use tools and APIs

- Maintain conversational memory

- Perform reasoning using chains and agents

- Build real-world AI applications

---

## 🧠 My Understanding of LangChain

Through this repository, I have explored the following core concepts:

### 🔗 Chains

Chains allow combining multiple components together to form a workflow.

Examples:

- Prompt → LLM → Output Parser

- Retrieval → Context Injection → LLM Response

Chains help automate multi-step reasoning and improve response quality.

---

### 🤖 Agents

Agents extend chains by allowing LLMs to \*\*decide which tools to use dynamically\*\*.

Key capabilities:

- Tool selection

- Multi-step reasoning

- Autonomous task execution

Agents are useful for:

- API calling

- Knowledge retrieval

- Task automation

---

### 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG improves LLM accuracy by connecting models to external knowledge sources.

Pipeline:

1. Store documents in vector databases

2. Convert queries into embeddings

3. Retrieve relevant context

4. Generate grounded responses

Benefits:

- Reduces hallucinations

- Allows private data querying

- Improves factual correctness

---

### 🧾 Memory

LangChain supports conversation memory, enabling chatbots to:

- Remember past interactions

- Maintain context

- Improve user experience

---

### 🔧 Tool Integration

LangChain enables integration with:

- APIs

- Databases

- Vector stores

- External services

- Custom tools
